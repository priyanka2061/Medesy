          <br>
          <p class="gap">Private Limited Company is a type of organization wherein the ownership and management are
            separate. The capital of a company is provided by a group of individuals known as shareholders who entrust
            the responsibility of managing the company in the hands of individuals known as the Board of Directors.
            These forms of organizations are closely held, usually by family, friends, and relatives. Private limited
            companies may issue shares and can have a maximum of 200 shareholders and their shares cannot be traded on
            public exchanges, but they can get their shares listed if needed by converting to a public limited company.
            It is governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and regulated by the Companies Act, 2013.

                    eight-digit unique identification number which has lifetime validity. DIN is person-specific which
                    means that even if he is a director in 2 or more companies, he/she has to obtain only 1 DIN. If a
                    return, application, or information about the company is required by law,
                    the director who signs the return, application, or information will request a DIN under his
