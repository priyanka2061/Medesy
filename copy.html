                        music, and artistic work. Producers of films and recordings enjoy this right too. When a
                        proprietor registers for a copyright, it gives them an exclusive right to reproduce, replicate,
                        and distribute the work. Further, they can grant authority to some other entity for the same
                        purpose.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Registering for copyright is important because it makes you the legal owner of the rights over
                        the work. You then have control over communicating it to the public, reproducing rights, any
                        adaptations or translations of the works.

                        <h3>How Copyrighting Works</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            A copyright protects the expression of an idea. Unlike a patent, which protects the idea
                            itself,
                            copyright protects only the expression.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As the owner of the copyright, the author has the unique right to produce copies of the
                            work, to
                            exhibit and perform it publicly, and to distribute copies of the work to the public. These
                            exclusive rights are valid for the author's lifetime plus 70 years. A work made for hire, on
                            the
                            other hand, has a copyright that lasts for a fixed period of 95 years from the date of
                            creation.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The work must be original to the creator in order to be protected by copyright. To be
                            unique,
                            the work should:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Instead of being taken from another work, it must have been created by the author(s)
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Must be capable of at least a basic level of creativity.</li><br>
                            <li>Note: The work will be terminated and will not be entitled to copyright protection if
                                these
                                two conditions are not met.</li><br>

                    <h3> Copyright Law and Treaties</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Copyright Act 1957 (the Act), supported by the Copyright Rules 1958 (the Rules), is the
                        governing law for copyright protection in India. Substantial amendments carries out to the
                        Copyright Act in 2012. India follows a common law legal system, so relies on case law to
                        interpret and set precedents in law and so the judicial decisions contribute to the sources of
                        copyright law in India. India is a member of the Berne Conventions and Universal Copyright
                        Convention. The Government of India has also passed the International Copyright Order, 1999.
                        According to this Order, any work first published in any country that is a member of any of the
                        above conventions is granted the same treatment as if it was first published in India.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The copyright law aims to balance the interests of those who create content, with the public
                        interest in having the widest possible access to that content. WIPO administers several
                        international treaties in the area of copyright and related rights.

                    <h3>What Can Be Protected By Copyright?</h3> <br>
                    <p>
                        Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including
                        literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer
                        software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of
                        operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>
                        Nine categories of works are copyrightable:
                    </h3>
                    <br>


                    <div class="ICI">
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Books -</b> Copyright protection provides legal protection to the author's works in
                                the
                                case of literary works. Since everything is altered, transferred, and copied so quickly
                                in
                                our era, the copyright registration for literary work is more commonly used for book
                                publishing and newsletters.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Software -</b> The IT sector in India is quickly expanding, necessitating the
                                protection
                                of your unique work or software. Many programmers, coders, and developers get cheated
                                when
                                they come across software that is close to or identical to what they created. The
                                copyright
                                registration for software prevents any individual or third-party company from gaining
                                unofficial access to the software.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Scripts -</b> A script is a written outline for a play, television programme, or
                                film.
                                Copyrighting a creative work—such as a script—prevents individuals from engaging in
                                unauthorised use of your script, such as intentional and accidental copying, publishing,
                                transmitting, exhibiting, distributing, modifying, and displaying other people's
                                original
                                creative expressions.</li><br>
                            </li><br>
                            <li><b>Lyrics -</b> When you register a copyright, you have full copyright protection for
                                your
                                song. Copyright protects your lyrics as soon as you write them, even if it's only on a
                                bit
                                of paper. The copyright registration of lyrics gives the song constructive notice. The
                                melody, lyrics, percussion track on the recording and chord progression in the bridge
                                are
                                all distinct and expressive elements to which the author might claim any of the
                                exclusive
                                rights.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Websites -</b> Text, tables, computer programmes, compilations, including computer
                                databases; photographs, paintings, diagrams, maps, charts, and plans; and works
                                incorporating music, including graphical notation of such work that may be copyrightable
                                are
                                among the digital assets on the website. You only have copyright rights to the elements
                                of a
                                website that you created as an author.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Apps -</b> Copyrights can be used to safeguard intellectual property such as computer
                                programs. Early designs of creativity can take on many forms, including software code,
                                graphics, and models used to create mobile applications and other computer software.
                                Copyright registration of software allows a developer to more easily defend his work if
                                it
                                is attempted to be copied. For software copyrights, the code, as well as copies of
                                artwork
                                and audiovisual content, must be included with the application.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Videos -</b> Copyright registration for video serves as a clear evidence in any
                                copyright
                                infringement lawsuit you may file, and it makes collecting damages much easier in such a
                                situation. It's a simple way to establish your video rights. If you actually want to
                                protect
                                your work, copyrighting your videos should be at the top of your priority list.</li><br>
                            </li><br>
                            <li><b>Songs -</b> It is important to obtain copyright protection for your song, as it is
                                now
                                easier than ever for others to use your work without giving you the credit you deserve.
                                If
                                you're a new musician, it's even more crucial to think about copyright protection
                                because
                                you might not have the resources to fight if your song is misused/pirated.</li><br>

                            <li><b>Music -</b> Whether you're attempting to safeguard a song or a symphony, the first
                                step
                                is to get the music down in some tangible format, such as recording or writing on music
                                staff paper. It can be difficult to assert your rights in a copyright infringement claim
                                if
                                you do not have recognised copyright for your music. And as a musician with registered
                                copyright for your work, you have a lot of exclusive rights.</li><br>

                    <p>
                        The Copyright Act of 1957 prevents the unauthorized use of any original literary, musical,
                        dramatic, audio, cinematographic, and other artistic work. Both published and unpublished works
                        can be copyrighted, and the original work’s copyright is reserved for the original creator.
                        Copyright can also be registered for works that were published before 21 January 1958, that is
                        before the Copyright Act came into existence.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Copyright protection of original literary, musical, dramatic, and artistic works lasts for the
                        entire lifetime of the author and another 60 years from the year following the death of the
                        author. For cinematograph films, sound recordings, photographs, posthumous publications,
                        anonymous and pseudonymous publications, works of government, and works of international
                        organizations, the 60 years is counted from the date of publication.
