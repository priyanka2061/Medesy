    <h1 class="heading">What Is A Partnership Firm ?</h3>
        <div class="boxx1">
               <p>A partnership is a type of business organization in which two or more people come together to run and operate a Firm in accordance with the conditions and purposes set out in the partnership deed.</p> <br>
                <p>If there is only one promoter/founder, One Person Company (OPC) is the best way to start a company. 
                    Partnership deed is an agreement between the partners in which rights, duties, profits shares and other obligations of each partner is mentioned.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    A Partnership is easy to form, and the compliance is minimal as compared to companies.

                    <br>
                    <p> Indian Partnership Act, 1932 governs the partnerships. Registration of partnership firm is optional and at the discretion of the partners. <br>
                        By introducing a limited liability partnership (LLP), one may opine that Partnership firms has lost relevance because partners have unlimited liability, which means they are personally liable for the debts of the business which is not in case of LLP. <br>
                        However, Partnership Firms are preferred since there are low costs of setting up the business and minimal compliance requirements, which makes it a sensible option for home/closed family businesses that are unlikely to take on any debt. Registration with Registrar of firms (ROF) is optional for Partnerships but advisable.

                                            Yes, a firm can be converted into LLP or PLC by following the procedures laid down in the acts. However, converting a partnership 
                                            into a company or LLP is cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. It is therefore advisable for many entrepreneurs to 
                                            consider and set up LLP or a company instead of a partnership.
