        <p class="gap">FSSAI (Food Safety Standard Authority of India) is a prominent government-backed entity that
          regulates the food sector in India.
          It has outlined countless guidelines and provisions to foster food safety across the nation. Presently, every
          food business in India is mandated to secure
          an applicable food license to conduct its business operation. Functioning without a valid food license is a
          punishable offence for FBOs as per FSS Act, 2006.
          FSSAI conducts all its operations in view of the said Act and also follows the direction of the Ministry of
          Health and Family Welfare. </p>

        <h1>Role of Food Safety Standard Authority of India</h1>
        <br>
        <ul>

          <li>Introducing initiatives related to food safety awareness </li>

        </ul><br>
        <p>FSSAI has underpinned stringent norms for proprietary food units as the majority of them conduct their
          operation without any norms.
          FSSAI has mandated these facilities to secure FSSAI licenses without any exception.
          As per the FSSAI, unregistered proprietary food units are not allowed to continue their business operation
          without a valid food license. </p>
        <br>
        <p id="laws">FSSAI has rolled the mandatory provisions for FBO and regulation of manufacturing, storage, sale, &
          distribution process to ensure utmost food safety and hygiene.
          The authority has also set up a legitimate information network for the awareness of the masses to secure valid
          information related to food safety and hygiene.</p>
