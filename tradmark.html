                    <p>A trademark can be defined as the unique identity that makes your company, product,
                        or service stand out from the rest. A registered trademark is your business’s intellectual
                        property intangible asset. It protects the investment made into creating trust and loyalty
                        among your customers.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p> The registration provides the right to sue against others who try to copy your trademark and
                        prevents others from using a similar trademark to the one registered by you</p>.
                    <br>

                    <h1>What Can You Register As a Trademark?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p> Many aspects of your brand image can be registered as a trademark. The aspect you need to
                        consider is which aspect of your brand stands out to your customers. Pick that aspect(s) for
                        registering.</p><br>

                    <h3> 1. Name</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        <b> a. Product Name:</b> You can register a particular product’s name as a trademark. Apple’s
                        iPod is a product name trademark.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <b> b. Business Name:</b> Registering a company name as a trademark is the most common route
                        businesses take. Ex: Bajaj.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <b> c. Person’s Name/Surname:</b> If your name plays an important part in generating revenue,
                        then you can even trademark your name! Ex: Shah Rukh Khan has trademarked his name.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <b> d. Abbreviations:</b> Abbreviations of a company or brand name can also be a trademark. Ex:
                        BMW.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3> 2. Logo/Symbol</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        It is highly recommended to trademark a logo because it visually represents your brand. Your
                        customers can recollect a logo faster than a name. A great example of a logo trademark is the
                        ‘swoosh’ of Nike.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3> 3. Tagline</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        If you have a tagline for your brand, you can go ahead and trademark that as well. A tagline
                        tells your customers what you stand for as a business. For example, KFC’s ‘It's finger lickin'
                        good’.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>4. Other Options</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        <b> a. Colour Mark:</b> You can trademark a colour or a combination of colours. (Ex: Cadbury has
                        trademarked the colour royal blue)
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <b>b. Sound Mark:</b> Musical notes or sounds can be trademarked if we can prove that it's
                        distinctive. Nokia has trademarked its tune.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> <b> c. Scent Mark:</b> Even scents can be trademarked.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p> Trademark registration is important and necessary for a business because:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>It showcases your unique identity</li><br>
                        <li>It helps you build trust and loyalty among your customers</li><br>
                        <li> It offers legal protection for your brand’s identity</li><br>
                        <li>It is an asset in itself</li><br>
                        <li>It prevents unauthorized usage of your brand’s identity.</li><br>
                    </ul>

                    <h1 id="eligibility"> Trademark Classes</h1>
                    <br>

                    <p>here are 45 trademark classes and all the goods and services are categorised across these
                        classes. You need to be very careful while picking the classes as it will determine the validity
                        of your trademark for your business’ products/services. If your business operates across
                        different goods/services that fall under different classes, you have to ensure that you apply
                        for the trademark under all the applicable classes.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some of the popular trademark classes in India are:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>class 9:</b> which includes computer software and electronics,</li><br>
                        <li><b>class 25:</b> which includes clothing,</li><br>
                        <li><b>class 35:</b> which includes business management and advertising, and</li><br>
                        <li><b>class 41:</b> which includes education and entertainment.</li><br>
                        <p>If you are operating within these trademark classes, the competition for a trademark might be
                            higher. However, that shouldn’t matter as long as your mark is unique.</p>
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        Once you give us the basic information about what you want to trademark and the industry you
                        operate in, our experts will do a thorough search across the trademark database. This is to
                        check whether the mark you want to register is available or not.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Once you decide on an available trademark, we move to step 2.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes the examiner might have some questions about your application. This is sent to you as
                        a trademark objection notice and you need to respond to it within 30 days. Our experts can craft
                        a strong objection response and guide you in submitting the right documents and proofs.

                        Step 5: Trademark Opposition (in some cases)</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        There is also a chance for a third party to oppose your application. In that case, you have to
                        submit a counter-statement to the Registrar within 2 months stating why the opposition isn’t
                        valid. Based on your response the Registrar may either dismiss the opposition or call for a
                        hearing.

                    <p>
                        In some cases, the trademark examiner might see certain problems or issues with the registration
                        of your trademark. These issues can be either the filing of an incorrect trademark form,
                        incorrect name/details, the usage of deceptive or offensive terms, insufficient information on
                        goods or services, or the existence of an identical or deceptively similar mark.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        When an objection is raised, the status on the register will show as ‘Objected’, following which
                        an expertly drafted response will need to be filed after an analysis of the objection itself and
                        with any supporting documents and proofs. Objection response is your opportunity to strengthen
                        the claim over your mark and create urgency.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        If the response is accepted, the application will be processed further for registration and
                        advertisement in the Trademark Journal. If it is not accepted, or if there are additional
                        clarifications sought by the examiner, there could be a trademark hearing scheduled and this
                        will be communicated to you by a notice.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The process typically takes 2-4 months from when the objection is first raised. Once completed,
                        the chances for approval, while not guaranteed, are much higher.

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, A trademark opposition is a legal proceeding in which one party attempts to
                        put a stop to a trademark application from being granted. A trademark opposition is filed by
                        third parties who feel your trademark could in some way impact them or their own trademark, in
                        writing, in the form of a notice, with the trademark examiner. If the examiner sees any merit to
                        the opposition, they are to forward the notice to the applicant, who is required to send in a
                        counter statement to the Registrar within 2 months.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If the Registrar feels the counter statement addresses the opposition substantially, they may
                        dismiss the opposition. Alternatively, if the registrar feels there is more to be weighed, they
                        may call for a hearing with both parties appearing before them and presenting their cases. After
                        the hearing, the Registrar will rule on the validity of either the application or the
                        opposition. This ruling can be appealed before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board within
                        3 months of it being made public.
