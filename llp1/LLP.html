          <p class="gap">Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is governed by the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008,
            and combines the benefits
            of a partnership firm with that of a private limited company.LLP is an alternate Corporate Business vehicle
            that provides the benefits of
            limited liability but allows its members the flexibility of organising their internal structure as a
            partnership based on mutually arrived agreement. It was intended to bridge the gap between the Companies Act
            and the Partnership Act, 1932. LLP was introduced to provide a type of business that is easy to maintain and
            operate. It also helps the owners by limiting their liability. Since its inception in 2010, LLP has been
            widely accepted as a business venture in India.

          <br>
          <ul>

            <h3 >
              <li>Separate Legal Entity</li>
            </h3>
            <p >LLP enjoys the advantages of a separate legal identity within the meaning of
              the law, which clearly
              states that company assets and liabilities are not partner assets and liabilities.</p><br>
            <h3 >
              <li>Limited Liability of Partners </li>
            </h3>
            <p >The partners of an LLP are not liable to bring any further personal
              contribution for settlement of
              dues of the company, over and above their capital contribution.</p><br>
            <h3 >
              <li>Perpetual Succession</li>
            </h3>
            <p >Like a company, its existence continues even after the exit/retirement/death
              of partners.</p><br>
            <h3 >
              <li>No Minimum Capital</li>
            </h3>
            <p >No minimum capital is required for LLP incorporation. It can be even
              registered with Rs. 1,000 as total
              capital contribution from a partner.</p><br>
            <h3 >
              <li>Simple procedures for transfer of Ownership</li>
            </h3>
            <p >The interest in limited partnerships has no influence on their existence, as
              they can be easily transferred
              through the introduction of a new designated partner in the LLP and are independent legal entities.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 >
              <li>Audit is not compulsory</li>
            </h3>
            <p >LLPs having a capital amount of lower than Rs. 25 lakh and turnover below Rs.
              40 lakh per year do not require
              any formal audits.</p><br>
            <h3 >
              <li>LLP Tax Benefits</li>
            </h3>
            <p >Various taxes such as dividend distribution tax and alternative minimum tax
              are also exempt.
              The LLP tax rates are low compared to companies.</p>
