          <br>
          <p class="gap">MSME stands for Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises which is governed by the MSME
            Act. MSMEs are considered as the backbone of our economy because when this sector grows,
            the whole economy of the country grows and flourishes.
            The government, therefore, has taken various steps to resolve the financing and cash flow
            situation faced by the MSME sector.
            MSME sector has created approximately 11 crore jobs across the country and contributes 29% to
            the Indian GDP which is even expected to grow more in the future given the government’s “Make in
            India” initiative.
            <br><br>
            The MSME sector was established to promote, develop and facilitate the competitiveness of
            smaller businesses in the economy.
            A business, whether in the manufacturing line or the service line, can register under the MSME
            act. It is not mandatory to take registration under MSME but it is advantageous for a business
            to get itself registered under MSME,
            because it provides various benefits in terms of setting up of business, credit facilities,
            loans, taxation etc.
