        <p>GeM (Government e-marketplace) listing
            The Government of India has created the GeM (Government E-Marketplace) platform to introduce 
            transparency to the previous Tender process for government procurement. The major goal of the 
            Government E-Marketplace portal is to improve transparency, efficiency, and speed in both governmental 
            procurement and employment. By registering through this portal, the seller as well as buyer can buy 
            or sell their products to the government.</p><br>

                with them. At each stage, purchasers and his association's president, as well as payment authorities 
                and sellers, receive SMS and e-mail notifications.</p>
