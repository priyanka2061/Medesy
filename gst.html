                <br>
                <p>Launched on July 1 2017, the Goods & Services Tax (GST) applies to all Indian service
                    providers (including freelancers), traders and manufacturers. A variety of Central taxes like
                    Service Tax, Excise Duty, CST and state taxes like Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, Octroi, VAT
                    are absorbed in one tax – GST, implemented on 01.07.2017. GST is to be charged at every step of
                    the supply chain, with full set-off benefits available. The procedure for GST is entirely online
                    and requires no manual intervention..</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Every product goes through multiple stages along the supply chain, which includes the purchasing
                    of raw materials, manufacturing, sale to the wholesaler, selling to the retailer and then the
                    final sale to the consumer. Interestingly, GST will be levied on all of these 3 stages. Let’s
                    say if a product is produced in West Bengal but is being consumed in Uttar Pradesh, the entire
                    revenue will go to Uttar Pradesh.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Also, taxpayers with a turnover of less than Rs.1.5 crore can choose composition scheme to get
                    rid of tedious GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover.</p>

                    <h1>What are the components of GST?</h1>

                    <p>
                        What are the components of GST?
                        GST will have 3 tax components, which includes a central component (Central Goods and
                        Services Tax or CGST) and a state component (State Goods and Services Tax or SGST) where
                        centre and state will levy GST on all entities, i.e. when a transaction happens within a
                        state. Inter-state transactions will attract the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST),
                        to be levied by the centre, i.e. when a transaction happens one state to another.
                    </p>

                    <div id="tax">
                        <h3>What is the input tax credit?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Input tax credit lets you reduce your tax you have already paid on inputs and pay the
                            remaining amount at the time of paying tax.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You pay taxes on the purchase when a product is purchased from a registered seller, and
                            when you sell the product, you too collect the tax. With input credit, you can adjust
                            the taxes paid at the time of purchase with the amount of tax on sales (output tax) and
                            pay the balance liability of tax, i.e. tax on sale minus tax on the purchase.
