        <div class="boxx1">
               <p> A sole proprietorship firm is a type of business entity that is owned, 
                controlled and managed by an individual person. A sole proprietor has complete control and 
                decision- <p> making power over the business.</p> <br>
                <p>Sole proprietorship businesses typically require less paperwork and are 
                    easier to maintain than partnerships or corporations. The business owner is responsible for the 
                    debts 
                   <p> and liabilities, and the accounting and record keeping methods are usually simple and 
                    straightforward. In simple words, sole proprietorship is one man business organisation.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="gap" >The Indian government has not established any separate rules and regulations 
                        for a sole proprietorship, and there is no registration process. The registration of the 
                        business can therefore only be identified on the basis of the tax registration required in 
                        the company. These tax registrations may include a GST registration and / or an SSI / MSME 
                        registration that must be obtained on behalf of the owner to determine that the owner runs 
                        the company as a sole proprietorship. It’s a good option for those who want to provide a 
                        platform to their business idea and try out something they want to do with minimal investment.

                    <h1>Advantages</h1><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Quick Decision Making</b></li>
                        <p >The promoter has complete and direct control over all decision making which ensures quicker business decisions and hence, faster execution.
                        </p><br>

                        <li><b>Easy to Start and Inexpensive</b></li>
                       <p>The process for starting a sole proprietorship firm is easier compared to other business structures and can be completed within 1 working day. Registration is cheaper than all other types of organization. Due to the minimum requirement to comply with the rules, current costs and staffing requirements, the running costs and manpower costs are low.                     
                        </p><br>

                        <li><b>Tax Benefits</b></li>
                        <p>The benefits of sole proprietorship is that it prevents double taxation of the firm. You will file returns and pay taxes only in your personal name. There are no separate income tax returns to be filed and no tax to be paid by the firm. The business is taxed at the personal income tax rate instead of the corporate tax rate. This leads to enormous tax savings.

                            <p>This means in case the business assets are not sufficient to pay of the business liabilities, then personal assets of sole proprietor would be sold to pay off the liability.
                            </p><br>
                            <li><b>Transferability</b></li>
                            <p>Any license or registration obtained in the name of the proprietorship cannot be transferred to any other person or entity. 
                            </p><br>

                            <li><b>No perpetual succession</b></li>
                            <p>A sole proprietorship firm has no separate legal existence. It is dissolved upon the death of a proprietor.
                            </p><br>

                            <li><b>Raising of Funds</b></li>
                            <p>A sole proprietorship cannot raise capital by selling stock. The difficulty of raising funds forces the owner to rely on his own savings and loans from friends and family.
